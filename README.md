This project is done as a homework assignment for the course NWI-IBC016 
Combinatorics taught by the Radboud University.

It aims to solve recurrence relations where the recurrence relation is a linear
(non)homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients.

It relies heavily upon the information and theorems given by the book 
Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Kenneth H. Rosen, 7th Edition.

It is created by Quoc An Ha.
